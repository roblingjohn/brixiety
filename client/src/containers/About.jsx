          As a fan of webcomics, I came across a lot of comics that were very
          relatable to me. This made me want to make my own webcomic so I could
          share my experiences, especially with anxiety, in hopes that other
          people can relate to me as well. However, I can't draw to save my
          life, so I figured I could use the thousands of dollars worth of LEGOs
          I have acquired since my childhood to convey my ideas.
